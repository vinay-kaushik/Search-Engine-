								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:</p>
<p>Congratulations on the completion of spring semester 2020, an ending to an academic year unlike any we could have imagined last fall! Traditionally, this week is a time when many students and faculty would be leaving campus and wanting to settle accounts with campus services including the library.</p>
<p>Given our current situation, patrons are encouraged to keep UIC and I-Share library materials until the library buildings are reopened. However, those who would prefer to return such items can place them in the book return slots accessible from outside each of the library&#8217;s facilities or return them by mail through the U.S. Postal Service. You can mail library materials at &#8220;media mail&#8221; (formerly book rate) prices; see https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-is-Media-Mail-Book-Rate. See the Library&#8217;s website for mailing addresses (https://library.uic.edu/libraries).</p>
<p>Even though you return your books now, please note that no Library employees are working in the building to check in these materials. You will continue to see items checked out to you on My Accounts (https://library.uic.edu/accounts). However, no fines or fees are being charged as of March 14, 2020. When staff is allowed to return to the library facilities we will check in your books, and the updated status will be reflected in your account.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the UIC University Library is still providing services online: reference, research consultations, course reserves and instruction. Contact us at Ask a Librarian: https://library.uic.edu/contact.</p>
<p>Have a safe and restful summer!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>
<p>I write to announce the appointment of Dr. Karen Colley, Dean of the Graduate College, as the Interim University Librarian and Dean of Libraries, effective August 1, 2020, subject to approval by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees. This interim appointment will allow for the continued transition in leadership following the retirement of Dean Mary Case.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>
<p>Like many of you, I look forward to a time when we can be together again on campus. I genuinely miss our community and the celebratory spirit that emerges during this time of year.</p>
<p>Although we must continue to practice physical distancing, it will not keep us from celebrating the accomplishments of our 2020 graduates. We will host a <a href="https://commencement.uic.edu/">virtual graduation celebration on May 16</a> to honor the hard work of our graduates and their families. Keep in mind, this celebration is not a replacement for in-person commencement ceremonies. We will invite all of our graduates to join us on campus at a later date, when health officials have deemed it is safe for public gatherings to resume.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we have teamed up with <a href="http://info.marchingorder.com/">Marching Order</a> to provide a tailored virtual ceremony for 14 of our 16 colleges. The College of Medicine and the Graduate College will hold separate online ceremonies to recognize their students. I invite each of you to celebrate with us online in May and in-person at a later date.</p>
<p>Please also share your photos and congratulatory messages on social media using #UICGrad20 and virtually wear a UIC cap and gown with our new Proud to be a 2020 UIC grad <a href="https://www.instagram.com/a/r/?effect_id=212808043384592">Instagram filter</a>.</p>
<p>In recognition of everyones commitment and resilience, we are showcasing UICs impact on the community, thanking our frontline workers, and honoring our 2020 graduates with a media campaign airing on NBC and Telemundo. You can find the spots on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/uicmedia">YouTube channel</a> along with several recent videos showcasing our efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will also launch special content honoring our graduates during the week of May 11th.</p>

<p>I deeply appreciate all that you do to support UIC during these unprecedented times. Please join me in congratulating the Class of 2020!</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Dear students, faculty and staff, I know that many of [&#8230;]]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>
<p>I know that many of you are eager to learn more about the fall semester, and if and how we are going to return to normal operations on campus.</p>
<p>Personal engagement  inside and outside of the classrooms and laboratories  is at the core of the higher education experience. As a result, there is a strong desire and urge to return to campus as soon as possible!</p>
<p>At the same time, we have an obligation to protect the health and safety of all members of the UIC community, their families, our most vulnerable members, and our surrounding communities.</p>
<p>With these principles in mind, we have established two campus-wide taskforces, led by Provost Susan Poser and Vice Chancellor John Coronado, to develop a blueprint for the return to campus. These taskforces have been working for the last three weeks, preparing plans for different scenarios. As you know, the public health parameters of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the guidelines from CDC and the State of Illinois, are changing very frequently, thus, importing a high level of uncertainty in our planning efforts.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, President Killeen also announced a <a href="https://emails.illinois.edu/newsletter/5554412.html">system-wide coordinating committee</a> to support the U of I universities in their efforts. This committee will be a valuable resource, as we plan for and address the complex issues that we are facing. Careful planning will take some time and will also have a significant component of flexibility, so we can respond quickly to external factors beyond our control. It is also possible  and some may argue even probable  that we will have to make changes in our operations during the course of the fall semester and we will be ready for such changes as well.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we have reached some early conclusions that we are ready to implement. First, all lecture classes for undergraduate students with more than 70 participants will be online. The infrastructure at UIC simply prohibits us from offering these classes on campus while adhering to the physical distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>This decision will allow us to move classes with a smaller number of participants into classrooms that are significantly larger, in order to achieve the physical distancing needed. Because of our relatively small footprint, even some smaller classes will need to be offered either through a remote or online platform. Furthermore, all on-campus classes will have to be accessible remotely, so students with health concerns or international students who cannot return to campus can continue their education uninterrupted. Finally, we expect that every first-year student will have some on-campus classes so that these students can begin to build connections with their peers and to the campus.</p>
<p>The operations taskforce led by Vice Chancellor Coronado is addressing issues of safety, hygiene, protection equipment, residence halls, distancing around campus, transportation and parking. It is also preparing a long list of supplies and resources needed to return to our normal operations.</p>
<p>Both taskforces will seek input from all members of our community and will provide updates on the progress of planning on a frequent basis going forward. In the meantime, we will continue to follow Governor J.B. Pritzkers stay-at-home order which has been <a href="https://www2.illinois.gov/Pages/news-item.aspx?ReleaseID=21459">extended until May 30</a>. UIC operations are expected to continue as they have since the beginning of the stay-at-home order, with limited changes due to operational needs.</p>
<p>When the Governors order is lifted, priority will be given to the reopening of research labs. The operations taskforce together with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research are preparing for this phase using the same principles and plans that are considered for the fall. More information will be communicated when public health indicators suggest that we are approaching this point.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to remind everyone, that as most of us are staying at home, thousands of our UIC colleagues who are classified as essential workers are coming to campus at UI Health, at our Police Department, at our administrative, IT and student services divisions and at our core research facilities. We are ever grateful to all of you who show up every day committed to caring for patients and students and protecting and supporting our core mission!</p>
<p>Together we will stay well, stay informed and stay positive.</p>
<p>Michael D. Amiridis<br />
Chancellor</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Health care workers can now participate in HERO research program ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<p>Health care workers at the University of Illinois
Hospital and Health Sciences System, or UI Health, are now eligible to
participate in a national registry of clinicians working on the frontlines of
the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>



<p>UI Health is part of the University of Illinois at Chicago, which is among the first institutions in the nation to participate in the Healthcare Worker Exposure Response and Outcomes Registry. </p>



<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://heroesresearch.org/" target="_blank">HERO Registry</a> seeks to engage health care workers, understand their experiences and track their health outcomes related to the pandemic  from COVID-19 infection to stress and burnout. Participant experiences and health outcomes will be tracked via surveys and opportunities, to participate in clinical trials. </p>



<p>As part of the registry, health care workers at UI Health also will have the opportunity to participate in future COVID-19 clinical trials, such as an upcoming study of hydroxychloroquine&#8217;s effectiveness in preventing coronavirus infections in health care workers. This <a href="https://heroesresearch.org/hero-hcq/">study</a>, the first for the HERO Registry, will enroll approximately 15,000 health care workers from participating institutions in the clinical trial to see if hydroxychloroquine performs better than placebo at preventing COVID-19. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/experts/susan-bleasdale/susan-casey-bleasdale-md-fidsa-facp"><img src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-271x406.jpg" alt="Susan Casey Bleasdale, MD, FIDSA, FACP" class="wp-image-92859" width="203" height="305" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-271x406.jpg 271w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-172x258.jpg 172w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-500x750.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-1000x1500.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" /></a><figcaption>Dr. Susan Bleasdale</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>&#8220;This is a great opportunity for our health care workers to share their experiences and the challenges they face as frontline care providers,&#8221; said UIC&#8217;s Dr. Susan Bleasdale, associate professor of clinical medicine at the College of Medicine, medical director of infection prevention at UI Health and principal investigator of the HERO hydroxychloroquine study at UIC. &#8220;We need to study what is happening among health care providers with the same dedication we study what is happening to patients.</p>



<p>&#8220;This information is vital to understanding what
works and what doesn&#8217;t work as we start thinking through the best ways to protect
health care workers, emerge from this crisis and learn from it,&#8221; said
Bleasdale, who is an infectious disease expert. </p>



<p>Bleasdale said that documenting the experiences of health
care providers in real-time during the COVID-19 pandemic can provide invaluable
information to public health departments, hospitals and infectious disease
experts on how to prepare for future outbreaks or a second wave of the COVID-19
pandemic. </p>



<p>The hydroxychloroquine study is expected to begin
enrolling health care workers through the HERO registry on May 4.</p>



<p>The HERO research program leverages <a href="https://pcornet.org/">PCORnet</a>, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network, and is funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. </p>



<p>More information about the HERO Registry, which is led by Duke University, is available <a href="https://heroesresearch.org/">online</a>. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">Dear UIC Students,</p>
<p>Please read the entirety of this e-mail as the Summer 2020 CTA U-PASS program will be different than any previous semester.</p>
<p>For summer 2020 only, the CTA U-PASS is being offered to students who OPT-IN to the program. The <a href="http://go.uic.edu/summer_upass">2020 CTA Summer U-PASS program</a> will be available for any full-time summer session student that elects to opt-in prior to May 10. Unfortunately, no exceptions can be made to missing this deadline.</p>
<p>The summer U-PASS will be active from June 1 through August 12, and the corresponding fee of $94 will be applied to your student account after June 1. This is not a mandatory fee, so it will not be included in your financial aid cost of attendance.</p>
<p>This benefit is only available to full-time (6+ credit hours for undergraduate/professional and 5+ credit hours for graduate level) summer session students.</p>
<ul>
<li>The summer U-PASS will be active from June 1-August 12.</li>
<li>The deadline to OPT-IN for the summer U-PASS is May 10 at midnight CDT. After the deadline, the opt-status cannot be changed.</li>
<li>If there is a change in your credit hours prior to June 1, it may impact your ability to participate.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">Dear Students, Staff, and Faculty,</p>
<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an alarming increase in discriminatory incidents directed at Asians and Asian Americans across this country and across the world. The labeling of COVID-19 as the Wuhan Virus and the wide circulation of derogatory social media memes can have harmful consequences for Asians and Asian Americans everywhere and devalue the many contributions they have made to this country for centuries.</p>
<p>So in addition to worrying about the health and well-being of their families and the impact of this pandemic on their work and personal lives, as we all are, members of Asian and Asian American communities, including UICs own community, have been experiencing discriminatory acts ranging from name-calling and bullying to physical attacks.</p>
<p>At UIC, we have a long history of working very closely with the many Asian American communities of Chicago and we are very proud to count a large number of Asian and Asian American students and alumni in our ranks. It goes without saying that we denounce these xenophobic practices and rhetoric, which are antithetical to our ethos and culture, and we will not tolerate any form of harassment against Asian and Asian American students, faculty and staff. We recognize that members of our own community may be experiencing such ostracism and violence and that this may be impacting their mental health and well-being. We want you to know that we are here to support you.</p>
<p>Campus units that can provide support include the <a href="https://glas.uic.edu/">Global Asian Studies Program</a>, the <a href="https://aarcc.uic.edu/">Asian American Resource and Cultural Center</a>, the <a href="https://dos.uic.edu/">Office of the Dean of Students</a> and the <a href="https://www.ois.uic.edu/">Office of International Services</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a member of our UIC community who has experienced any form of prejudice, discrimination, or harassment on or off campus and would like to report it, please fill out this <a href="https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?UnivofIllinoisChicago&amp;layout_id=24">online form</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about the history of xenophobia and racism towards Asians and Asian Americans, you can find <a href="https://glas.uic.edu/career-and-resources/teaching-against-racism/">educational resources online</a>.</p>
<p>We are, indeed, all in this together and we ask everyone to take extra care during this time to support each other so that we will emerge from this extraordinary period as an even stronger and more compassionate community.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Amiridis<br />
Chancellor</p>

<p>UI Health Mile Square Health Center  a network of federally qualified health centers, or FQHCs, in Chicago  is now providing COVID-19 testing to community members on the South Side who meet testing criteria at its South Shore clinic, located at 7037 S. Stony Island Ave. </p>



<p>Previously, only established or new Mile Square patients with symptoms were able to get a test. Now, any person in the community who meets testing criteria, such as having symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea, can make an appointment to get tested. Test results will be available in one to two days. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are proud to respond to the needs of the South Shore community and to play an active role in addressing COVID-19 disparities,&#8221; said Dr. Ian Jasenof, chief medical officer of UI Health Mile Square Health Center.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mile Square has a long history of bringing health care to communities regardless of individuals&#8217; income, insurance status or ability to pay for care  expanding our COVID-19 testing capacity on Chicago&#8217;s South Side is an extension of our promise to put the health and well-being of all communities at the center of all we do,&#8221; said Henry Taylor, executive director of the UI Health Mile Square network.</p>



<p>The South Shore clinic began testing a limited number of patients today but will test patients by appointment, 10 a.m to 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, starting tomorrow. The clinic is prepared to provide up to 30 tests a day. </p>



<p>As part of its expanded testing program, Mile Square has formalized a home monitoring program for individuals who test positive. </p>



<p>&#8220;Follow up and monitoring COVID-19 progression is just
as important as testing,&#8221; Jasenof said. &#8220;We still do not know why some
people with COVID-19 have mild illness while others have severe and
life-threatening illness. This monitoring process was developed to make sure
that if people do become severely ill, they have resources in place to get help
quickly.&#8221; </p>



<p>The South Shore clinic occupies space owned and operated by the Chicago Child Care Society, in Chicago&#8217;s 5th Ward.</p>



<p>I welcome Mile Squares capacity to start testing in Shore Shore, which is one of the communities hardest hit by the pandemic. While 30 tests per day are a good first start, I hope the staff will have the resources to increase the number of daily tests, said 5th Ward Ald. Leslie Hairston. We know the key to flattening the curve is treatment, testing and tracking.</p>



<p>Dara Munson, CEO of the Chicago Child Care Society, said, Chicago Child Care Society has a long-standing commitment to the South Shore neighborhood and is a proud partner with UI Mile Square Health Center. We are saddened but not surprised by the disparities that COVID-19 is illuminating. CCCS is committed to doing our part to serve this and all communities during this pandemic and beyond.</p>



<p>The South Shore clinic is the third official testing site in the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System. The UI Health Mile Square drive-up testing center, located at 1220 S. Wood St., tested its first patient on March 25, and the Pilsen COVID-19 evaluation clinic, located at 1713 S. Ashland Ave., began evaluating and testing patients on March 30. </p>



<p>Combined, these three UI Health testing centers can process around
150 tests each day. </p>



<p>At this time, all testing centers are by appointment only and only for patients who meet testing criteria.</p>



<p>Patients should call 866-600-2273 to speak with a nurse to make an appointment or visit <a href="https://hospital.uillinois.edu/primary-and-specialty-care/infectious-diseases/covid-19-coronavirus/testing-and-triage">hospital.uillinois.edu</a> for more information. </p>



<p>Mile Square plans to expand its COVID-19 testing program to other locations as well. Next up is its clinic in Cicero, located at 474551 W. Cermak Road. Testing at this clinic is expected to start in early May. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce a $15.9 million emergency grant program.</p>
<p>The Department of Education has allocated $14.9 million for this grant through the CARES Act. In addition to the Department of Education funding, UIC has transferred $1 million from the Federal Work-Study Program as allowed by the federal government to supplement the emergency grant funding for any student eligible for Title IV Financial Aid funding.</p>
<p><strong>Undergraduate, graduate and professional students enrolled in the Spring Semester </strong>will be eligible to receive up to $1,000, if you have:</p>
<ol>

<p>An application is required to receive a grant. <strong>If you are eligible for the COVID-19 Emergency Grant, your portal at <a href="https://my.uic.edu/uPortal/f/welcome/normal/render.uP">https://my.uic.edu/uPortal/f/welcome/normal/render.uP</a> has been updated with a document for you to complete and upload</strong>. You should have received an email notification informing you that the requirement is posted.<u> Please complete the document immediately as applications will not be accepted after May 8, 2020.</u></p>
<p>If you do not meet the eligibility criteria for the COVID-19 Emergency Grant, you can apply for other Emergency Grant programs available at UIC, such as:</p>
<ul>
