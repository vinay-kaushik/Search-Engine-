				<description><![CDATA[UIC Students, Faculty and Staff, The UIC Police Department has [&#8230;]]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">UIC Students, Faculty and Staff,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The UIC Police Department has arrested two subjects in connection with a series of burglaries and thefts from the UIC Physical Education Building. During the past six months, UIC Police received several reports in which unknown offenders, on separate occasions, entered the building and removed valuable items including jewelry, electronics, clothing, and recording equipment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In each incident, surveillance footage captured the same suspects inside the building during the time of the reported thefts. In the course of the investigation, the suspects were positively identified as the offenders wanted in connection with these crimes. The UIC Police Department has recovered most of the stolen items. The suspects, who are not affiliated with UIC, are each charged with four counts of felony burglary. A third offender remains at large and is wanted for questioning.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As we approach the final weeks of the semester and the weather is increasingly getting warmer, I would like to remind you of some basic safety tips.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make sure doors are secure when leaving buildings after hours and do not leave doors propped open.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Immediately report any door that is not secure to the police.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Report suspicious people and activity immediately.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Unplug your ears. Take headphones off or have the volume turned down so you know what is happening around you.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Utilize the campus or city transportation system while out late at night.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">If you choose to be out late, please don’t walk alone.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I would like to thank everyone who assisted with the investigation. It takes a team effort to keep our campus and community safe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">UIC Police are available 24/7 to answer questions. Please contact us immediately if you see any suspicious activity or if you have been a victim of a crime.</span></p>

<p>A juvenile suspect was arrested May 24 in connection with an armed robbery near campus.</p>
<p>The 15-year-old suspect was identified by the victim, whose money and cell phone were stolen at gunpoint May 24 near 1410 S. Morgan St. The victim, who was not injured, is not affiliated with UIC.</p>
<p>The suspect was also identified in other off-campus robberies and charged with two counts of armed robbery and one count of aggravated robbery.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to thank our UIC Police/Chicago Police Department Joint Robbery Task Force, the men and women of the UIC Police Department, and our south campus community for their help with the investigation,&#8221; said UIC Police Chief Kevin Booker.</p>

<p>Tom Michael Kaniewski, 19, of 2413 N. 78th Court, Elmwood Park, was taken into custody at his residence and charged with one count of felony armed robbery. He remains in Cook County Jail in lieu of $200,000 bail.</p>
<p>Kaniewski and another offender allegedly asked to borrow the victim’s mobile phone, placed several calls, then displayed a knife when the victim asked for its return. The victim was not injured in the crime.</p>
<p>Suspects were identified with the help of CTA investigators using video surveillance and the victim’s description. Task force officers arrested a minor in connection with the robbery Dec. 15. He was convicted in juvenile court and awaits sentencing.</p>
<p>“The joint effort between UIC Police and CPD is essential in maintaining the safety and security of UIC and the surrounding communities,” UIC Police Chief Kevin Booker said.</p>
<p>The UIC Police Department is a force of sworn officers with statewide statutory powers of arrest. The department has a long tradition of community-based policing in partnership with the on- and off-campus community.</p>

<p>A Chicago man was arrested Jan. 26 for the Jan. 14 armed robbery of the Shell Station at Van Buren and Racine streets, the target of a series of robberies since November.</p>
<p>Surveillance video and information from witnesses, including a partial license plate number, helped officers locate the vehicle and identify the suspect when he returned to the car.</p>
<p>Everett Vaughn, 32, was charged with two counts of armed robbery with a firearm. Police said he is a suspect in several other area robberies.</p>
<p>Task force officers arrested two suspects thought to be responsible for the Jan. 16 off-campus robbery of a UIC student near Polk and Aberdeen streets, the subject of a UIC crime alert.</p>
<p>Two teens were robbed Jan. 24 in the 900 block of South Aberdeen Street in a crime similar to the earlier one. Two Chicago detectives patrolling the area found two men who were positively identified by the victims of the Jan. 24 crime and had items that had been stolen from the teens. The suspects were charged with the Jan. 24 crimes.</p>
<p>The task force also arrested a Chicago man as he fled after breaking into a UIC student&#8217;s apartment Jan. 30 on the 900 block of South Racine.</p>
<p>The student, who was home when he saw the man trying to get in, called police with a description before escaping. His roommate came home soon after and found the man, who robbed him, then fled as he heard the approaching sirens. Police chased the suspect several blocks across Arrigo Park and over a wall before he was caught.</p>
<p>Henry Hunt, 44, was charged with four counts of burglary and one count of robbery.</p>
<p>“These arrests demonstrate the effectiveness of the collaboration between UIC Police and the Chicago Police on our joint robbery task force,” said UIC Police Chief Kevin Booker.</p>
<p>“But the arrests would not have been possible without the active cooperation of crime victims and witnesses in promptly and accurately reporting crime to us. Security requires teamwork.”</p>

<p>The UIC Police Investigations Unit recovered nearly all the $35,000 worth of computer equipment and musical instruments stolen from the Education, Performing Arts and Social Work building, UIC Theatre, Behavioral Sciences Building, and Science and Engineering Offices building.</p>
<p>Police believe the men caused about $19,500 worth of damage to campus buildings, Sgt. Stan Grice said.</p>
<p>The five, who are not UIC students, were arrested at 8 a.m. Friday at 410 S. Morgan St.</p>
<p>Rodney Moore, 19, Emilio Guzman Jr., 24, Noah Benjamin Ferris, 18, Rasheed Williamson, 21, and Kenneth Stanek, 18, were charged in connection to the burglaries.</p>
<p>“All suspects confessed to the crimes,” Grice said.</p>
<p>The investigations unit identified Ferris after a trumpet he pawned was identified on a law enforcement database that lists items sold to pawn shops.</p>
<p>Upon further investigation, police identified another suspect who was one of four men seen on surveillance cameras walking through the Education, Performing Arts and Social Work building, checking doors for access to rooms.</p>
<p>“We kept digging and found out they lived at the same address,” Grice said. “I put a team together and we went to that address, and the building manager identified all five as living there.”</p>
<p>Many of the recovered items were found at the residence, police said.</p>
<p>The suspects are accused of causing “extensive criminal damage” in the Behavioral Sciences Building, smashing glass doors and damaging more than 20 computers, Grice said.</p>
<p>They are alleged to have broken into wooden lockers in the Education, Performing Arts and Social Work building to take musical instruments. Other items were also taken, including a sound mixer from the UIC Theatre.</p>
<p>About $7,000 worth of computer equipment from the Science and Engineering Offices was also taken, which was recovered, Grice said.</p>
<p>The suspects were charged with 17 felony charges: three counts of felony criminal damage and 14 counts of burglary, and one misdemeanor theft charge.<i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal;"><i> </i></span></i></p>
